# DATS6101_Project
Repository for DATS6101 Project focusing on US Accidents between 2016-2023

This project proposal is focused on a thorough investigation of the US Accidents dataset from 2016 to 2023 with the goal of identifying the causes of the increase in accidents and tracking their dynamic growth over time. This investigation will delve into various aspects, encompassing historical trends, geographical dispersion, severity assessments, weather-related impacts, driver attributes, contributing variables, vehicle categorizations, injury and fatality statistics, traffic conditions, substance-induced impairments, time-based examinations, correlations through statistical analysis and with the help of data visualization techniques.Getting a thorough knowledge of the elements that influence accidents in the United States by synthesizing this abundance of data, thereby enabling the formulation of road safety enhancement strategies.

**Objective/Scope of the project**

The project focuses on analysing, testing and modelling the US accidents occured between 2016 till 2023. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to get better understanding of the relation of the features in the data and how much it impacts the severity of the accident, along with that implementing statistical testing techniques to test hypothesis from the data.
