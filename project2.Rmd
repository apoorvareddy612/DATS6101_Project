## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Read the data from a CSV file
# Replace 'your_data.csv' with the actual file path
df <- read_csv('C:/Users/nupur/computer/Desktop/Intro_DS/DATS6101_Project/US_Accidents.csv')
df$Amenity <- as.factor(df$Amenity)

# Now create the bar plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = City, y = `Response time`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = "Response Time by City", x = "City", y = "Response Time") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Amenity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.6)) # Rotate x-axis labels

# If the graph is still unclear, use faceting (this assumes that there is a 'Region' column)
# p <- p + facet_wrap(~ Region)

# Print the plot
print(p)

# If you're saving to a file, you can specify dimensions to make the plot larger and less 'fuzzy'
ggsave("plot.png", p, width = 20, height = 10, units = "cm") 

```

```{r}
df$Amenity <- as.numeric(as.character(df$Amenity))
